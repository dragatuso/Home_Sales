# Home_Sales
The repository includes the code perform in order to complete the home sales analysis and the README file. Most of the code was developped based on the activities completed and reviewed during the Module 22 of the Data Analytics Bootcamp. I have also reviewed details in copilot and in different posts of Stack Overflow. It is important to highlight that to be able to run the code correctly in my laptop, I had to amend the first part of the starter code to run the Spark Session. Finally, the answers to the questions in the challenge are included throughout the code and label as "ans_5_x".
